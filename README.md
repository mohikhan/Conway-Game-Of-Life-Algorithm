# Conway-Game-Of-Life-Algorithm
The rules of the game are:
The Game Of Life is a cellular automaton algorithm. It runs on a universe, which is two-dimensional a grid of cells. Each cell can be in two states: alive or dead. There is an initial state for the universe, which defines alive cells and their positions in the universe. The automaton progresses one step at a time by applying a set of rules to each cell in the universe. There rules are the following:

1) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives;
2) Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell;
3) All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.


The universe was initially populated with a glider pattern and animate its progress.
